Readme for IONOS Managed Kubernetes Service

The managed k8s service uses APIs to create elements for hosting the k8s cluster
initally you will need to generate an apiKey or base64 username and password as the authorisation method to communicate via API

To generate base64 from your username and password use the below method to generate the base64 string 

echo -n 'username@domain.tld:password' | base64

this will return the base64 string eg:-y5nYWx.....h1YTgzOTI which can be used in the API calls

if you would like to use an apiKey instead then pass the base64 string with the auth API to generate the API key

curl --request GET \
-H 'Authorization: Basic y5nYWx.....h1YTgzOTI' \
https://api.ionos.com/auth/v1/tokens/generate/ 

This will respond with the apiKey which can then be used using the 'Authorization: Bearer' type as the method of authorisation for the API calls

the example below will display the valid apiKeys that have been created.

curl --request GET \
-H 'Authorization: Bearer eyJ0e....tYmJhMi1....iOiJpb25....Nsb3VkIiw' \
https://api.ionos.com/auth/v1/tokens
